# Real Estate Price Prediction Using Multi-source Data

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict real estate prices by combining data from multiple online platforms like SeLoger, Leboncoin, and Airbnb.

## Goals
- Scrape housing data from several French platforms
- Combine and clean multi-source datasets
- Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Build and evaluate regression models to predict housing prices
- Create a Power BI dashboard for interactive visualization

## Tech Stack
- Python (pandas, sklearn, matplotlib/seaborn, requests/BeautifulSoup)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Power BI
- Git/GitHub for version control

## Status
âœ… Project initialized
